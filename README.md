I'm a Cybersecurity Lead with solid application development and devops background, critical eye to detail, and "leave it better than you found it" mentality.

I have a keen interest in home automation, creative problem-solving, clean code, and information security. My most recent certifications include [AWS Certified Security](https://www.credly.com/badges/55be0ad4-b683-40fb-be2e-2471aab29720), [CCSP](https://www.credly.com/earner/earned/badge/48541ff0-42fa-4344-a31d-5a5d4515591c), [CISSP](https://www.credly.com/badges/53907d05-1928-49cb-b974-24e2165cdacf) ([CSSLP](https://www.isc2.org/certifications/csslp) is work in progress).

I'm dedicated to making impactful contributions to open source projects. Currently I lead [OWASP Nettacker](https://github.com/OWASP/Nettacker/) and [Python Holidays](https://github.com/vacanza/python-holidays/) development.
