I'm a Cybersecurity Lead with a solid secure application development and DevOps background, critical eye to detail, and "leave it better than you found it" mentality.

I have a keen interest in information security, home automation, creative problem-solving, and clean code. My most recent certifications include [AWS Certified Security](https://www.credly.com/badges/55be0ad4-b683-40fb-be2e-2471aab29720), [CCSP](https://www.credly.com/badges/48541ff0-42fa-4344-a31d-5a5d4515591c), [CISSP](https://www.credly.com/badges/53907d05-1928-49cb-b974-24e2165cdacf), and [CSSLP](https://www.credly.com/badges/c733a347-d1a6-4a9a-b9f0-9bda3c931aa7).

I love open source and currently lead [OWASP Nest](https://github.com/OWASP/Nest/), [OWASP Nettacker](https://github.com/OWASP/Nettacker/), and [Open World Holidays Framework](https://github.com/vacanza/) development.
